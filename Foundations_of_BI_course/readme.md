|  Data Tasks | Data Analyst (DA)  |  Business intelligence (BI) |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Involvement  | The first step of the data analysis cycle is to define the business problem and establish stakeholder expectations.  | In addition to defining business problems and asking questions to establish expectations, BI professionals observe current processes to determine how they can be improved to align more with stakeholder needs.  |
|  Answering questions |  Data analysts are often tasked with deciding what data they need to answer their stakeholders’ questions and gathering that data for use. | BI professionals evaluate the data needs of their stakeholders, identify necessary sources, and design pipeline systems that automatically and continuously gather that data for stakeholders to access.  |
|  Gathering data | Once data has been gathered, data analysts must ensure that it is clean and ready for use. They also perform transformations on the data to prepare it for analysis.  |  BI professionals build tools that clean and transform data automatically within a pipeline so that these processes occur to all data being ingested by the pipeline process. |
| Storage systems  | Data analysts must adhere to organization conventions and store historical data for analysis.  | BI professionals develop storage systems that allow intake from multiple source systems into a destination database, while governing the database schema and optimizing the system.  |
| Descriptive and predictive analytics  | Data analysis focuses on descriptive analysis that describes historical trends.  |  BI uses analysis of historical trends to perform predictive analytics that enable organizations to determine likely future trends and act accordingly. |
| Presenting insights  | After analysis, data analysts present their findings to inform the stakeholders’ ultimate decision.  | BI analysts create tables, reports, and dashboards that empower stakeholders with access to the data they need to inform their whole decision-making process.  |
| Iteration  | After analysis, data analysts present their findings to inform the stakeholders’ ultimate decision.  |  BI analysts continue to iterate on processes to improve and optimize the systems and tools they have built to ensure they continue to be useful for stakeholders. |


# Frameworks for organizing your thoughts about visualization
Frameworks can help you organize your thoughts about data visualization and give you a useful checklist to reference. Here are two frameworks that may be useful for you as you create your own data visualizations:
